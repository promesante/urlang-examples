       2. You can load a template in many ways. For convenience, we'll include it in
       a script tag so that we don't need to mess around with AJAX or multiline strings.
       Note that we've set the type attribute to 'text/ractive' - though it can be
       just about anything except 'text/javascript'

  <script id='template' type='text/ractive'>

  <h2>Country profile</h2>

    {{#with country}}
    <p>{{name}} is a {{climate.temperature}} country with {{climate.rainfall}} rainfall and a population of {{population}}.</p>

    <p>The capital city is {{capital.name}} (<a href='https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place/{{capital.name}}/@{{capital.lat}},{{capital.lon}},12z' target='_blank'>see map</a>).</p>
