# Urlang Examples

[Urlang](https://github.com/soegaard/urlang) is a language implemented on [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) which generates Javascript.

According to [Jens Axel SÃ¸gaard](https://github.com/soegaard), its author, "the heart of the system is a compiler written using the [Nanopass](http://nanopass.org/) compiler Framework".

As I am interested in all these projects, coding Urlang examples seems a sensible first step to begin learning about them all, at the same time.

I am coding examples, and sharing the resulting code in this repo and in my [blog](http://promesante.github.io/).
